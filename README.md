# Prime Star Pattern Printer

This Python script prints a symmetrical star pattern based on a given number `n`. The pattern consists of two parts: an upper half where the number of stars increases, and a lower half where the number of stars decreases, creating a diamond-like shape.

## Features

- Takes a user input `n` to determine the size of the pattern.
- Dynamically prints a symmetrical star pattern with `2*n - 1` rows.
- Simple and easy-to-read code structure.
- Fully documented with clear explanations.

## Requirements

No external dependencies are required. The script runs with the built-in Python standard libraries.

## Example

If you input `n = 4`, the script will produce the following pattern:
